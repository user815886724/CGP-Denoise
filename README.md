# Noise eliminator base on CGP
> In this paper, Cartesian Genetic Programming is used to find out the direct relationship between multiple measures and comprehensively describe the behavior of pixels from multiple dimensions to increase the robustness of detection results, and meanwhile two or more complementary feature detectors are constructed by using the multi gene output characteristics of model. Cartesian Genetic Programming evolves the optimal mathematical expression by using multiple measures and rank ordered statistics by using this expression to locate the corrupted pixels which is used to distinguish noise pixels from non-noise pixels to generate noise map. The experimental results show that the detector is robust and can detect noise more effectively than other detectors, even at high density. In recovery stage, the proposed an adaptive median and edge preserving filter(AMEPF) which consists of three-layer filters to enhancing the image similarity and structure continuity, the filter can eliminate noise and protect the integrity of the structure. In order to evaluate and show the effectiveness of the proposed method, a set of comprehensive experiments have been carried out on the standard data set and its performance has been verified. The results show that the damage recovery effect of different impulse noise intensity is better than the previous technology.
